API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They enable developers to access the functionality of a system or service without needing to understand its internal workings, making it easier to integrate different software components and create more powerful applications.
